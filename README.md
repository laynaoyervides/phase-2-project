# phase-2-project
React JS Single Page Application ; project for Flatiron School Phase 2

Project Description from Flatiron School;

Learning Goals
Build a React single page application from scratch
Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
Incorporate client-side routing
Use data from an API
Introduction
Now that you've learned the fundamentals of React, it's time to practice and expand your skills by making a React project from scratch!

This assignment is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed in these instructions.

Requirements
You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-router (Links to an external site.)
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
Stretch Goals
Once you have met the minimum requirements, feel free to explore! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.

Some ideas for stretch goals:

Incorporate data from an external API. Use this list of APIs (Links to an external site.) if you need some inspiration!
Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled-components (Links to an external site.) or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like react-bootstrap (Links to an external site.), semantic-ui (Links to an external site.) material-ui (Links to an external site.)) if you prefer.
